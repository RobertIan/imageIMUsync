this is the main folder for data acquisition (images, IMU, solar and depth information). All of the scripts can be used as a stand alone but main.py and mainLIGHT.py requires all of the scripts to be in the folder (or python path). The main program will take jpg images with complete RAW bayer data with IMU and depth information included with file names for reference.
